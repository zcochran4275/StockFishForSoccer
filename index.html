        <h1 class="title">Stockfish for Soccer?</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Passing in soccer has never been so easy.</p>
        <p class="into-paragraph">We have invented a new metric for how to quantify performance during a soccer match. Pass sequence xG, is a metric that measures the quality of a team's passing sequences. We have created a machine learning model using XGBoost that can take in a sequence of
            passes and predict the probability of a goal being scored involving those passes.
            This model has been trained on data from 2015/2016 seasons across the 5 biggest european leagues (La Liga,
            Premier League, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1).
            The model has been extensively trained on 1823 games and resulted in 1.8 million passing sequences. In this
            article we will use our model to analyze passing sequences from the 2024 UEFA Euro Tournament.</p>

                <h2>How do we define a pass sequence?</h2> <br></br>
                <h3>A pass sequence can be defined as a sequential list of passes where each pass has a set of features.
                    Some of the features include start and end location, pass type, pass height.
                    Using these features we can visually represent the sequence in 2D by plotting each pass as an arrow
                    and making its size proportional to its position in the sequence. We can additionally color code the
                    pass by it's outcome.</h3>

                <h2 style="text-align: center">Counter attacks have been a major talking point lately in soccer.
                    A counter attack typically consists of gaining possession and making a short sequence of
                    passes, usually 1-3, and then ending with a shot towards goal.
                    Here we take a look at how the number of passes in a sequence affects the pass sequence xG.
                </h2>
                <h3>Although the actual difference in pass sequence xG is not very large, about .7%, we see that a pass
                    sequence xG of around 2.5% is in the 75th percentile of pass sequence xG. While a pass sequence
                    xG of around 1.8% is in the 55th percentile.</h3>

                <h3>This is a huge difference of 20 percentile points! The context of the
                    passes is important and sequences that have a solid build-up can set up a "last
                    pass" in a good position to create a goal.</h3>

                <h2 style="text-align: center">We've established that 5 passes is optimal. Now, we can take a look at
                    the distribution of passes within those 5 pass
                    sequences.</h2>
                <h3>First thing that we can see is that goal kicks, free kicks, corners, and throw-ins all happen on the
                    first pass of a sequence. This should match our intuition and general knowledge for how soccer
                    works.
                    <br></br>
                    The next thing that is important to identify is the types of passes that can be labeled as sequence
                    ending. We see that through balls, crosses, and cutbacks all tend to end sequences at least 50% of
                    the time. We can attribute this to shots happening after each of these pass types.
                    <br></br>

                    the central areas. Most goals are scored from inside the 18-yard box, with the highest xG coming
                    from shots near the goal. </h3>
                <h3>Combining this with the previous findings, we can see that the location and context of passes are
                    crucial
                    in determining their effectiveness. Through balls, crosses, and cutbacks are all sequence-ending
                    passes
                    that are played into dangerous areas. They often lead to shots on goal, and as a result,
                    are more likely to result in high xG values.</h3>

                    pass is incomplete it is not likely to lead to a goal.<br></br>
                    We also see that a lot of these passes come from goal kicks, free kicks, and passes in the defensive
                    third and tend to be longer and in the air. In general, these passes are very hard to control as the
                    team in possession and are hard to create good goal scoring opportunities.

                    which is why they might not have as high of a pass sequence xG.<br></br>
                    Also, this is around the percentile where we begin to see some attempts at crossing. We see that
                    even incomplete crosses into the box have the same pass sequence xG as a completed pass in the
                    defensive third.

                    getting closer to goal and within shooting range.<br></br> Another key fact to note is that the

                    they are able to successfully get the ball into the box.<br></br>
                    We see the highest level of speciality in pass type as we see a spike in through balls, crosses, and

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <h2>
            In this article, we explored how a sequence of passes can be used to predict the likelihood of scoring a
            goal — a concept we refer to as pass sequence xG. Using real match data from UEFA Euro 2024, we examined the
            underlying features of effective passing sequences and how different elements contribute to increasing
            scoring probability.<br></br>

            A key takeaway from our analysis is the importance of the build-up phase. Far from being just a means of
            progressing the ball, the build-up creates the foundation for high-quality final passes. We highlighted how
            switches of play—lateral passes that shift the ball across the pitch—are especially effective in disrupting
            defensive structures and opening up space between lines. These types of passes consistently raised the pass
            sequencexG of subsequent actions by forcing defenders to reposition and creating exploitable gaps in the
            midfield.<br></br>

            We also identified the most dangerous zones on the pitch, offering insight into where players should aim to
            direct their attacks. Knowing where the threat is highest allows teams to shape their sequences more
            intelligently and maximize their offensive potential. Additionally, we examined how subtle variations in
            pass height and type—such as using through balls or lofted passes—can be strategically employed to overcome
            pressure and unlock better shooting opportunities.<br></br>

            To complement our findings, we’ve provided interactive tools that allow you to explore the influence of the
            final pass on a sequence’s xG. You can also build your own custom sequences to see how different
            combinations affect pass sequence xG. We invite you to dive in, experiment with different setups, and even
            analyze real moments from matches you watch. The next time you see a passing move unfold, consider what made
            it effective—or why it fell short—and use our model to test your observations.<br></br>

            Through this lens, we hope you gain a deeper appreciation of the strategy behind every pass and develop a
            new way to think about the beautiful game.
